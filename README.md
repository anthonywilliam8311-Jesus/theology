# Logos & Truth - website

A plain website (HTML, CSS and JavaScript). There is nothing to build or install:
upload the files to GitHub and turn on GitHub Pages.

## 1. Upload to GitHub
1. Create a public repository. Name it `YOURUSERNAME.github.io`.
2. Upload every file and folder of this project to the repository root, so that `index.html` sits at the top level.
   (On a computer: unzip first, then drag all files and folders into GitHub's "Add file > Upload files".
   On a phone: use "Add file > Create new file", type the file name such as `assets/app.js`, paste the code, and commit.)
3. Open **Settings > Pages**. Source = *Deploy from a branch*, Branch = `main`, Folder = `/ (root)`. Save.
4. After 1-2 minutes your site is live at `https://YOURUSERNAME.github.io`.

## 2. Add your articles
Articles are Markdown files inside the category folders:

```
articles/
  theology/          your-article.md
  apologetics/
  islamic-dilemma/   muhammad.md
  church-fathers/
```

To add one on GitHub: open the category folder, choose **Add file > Create new file**,
name it e.g. `jesus-as-god.md`, paste your text, and commit.

Start the file like this (all lines are optional - the site fills in what is missing):

```
---
title: "Jesus as God"
date: 2026-10-09
excerpt: "One or two sentences shown on article cards and in search."
---

## First heading

Your article text. Use **bold**, *italic*, [links](https://example.com),
lists with "-", numbered lists, and "> quotes".
```

- The folder name is the category. Capital letters or spaces are fine (`Islamic Dilemma` and `islamic-dilemma` are the same category).
- While someone reads, a slim **Related topics** bar stays at the bottom of the screen (related articles and category links). The arrow button hides it, and it tucks away by itself when the reader reaches the end of the article, where a full Related topics section is shown.
- New articles appear on the site within about 5 minutes.
- Files named `README.md` and files starting with `_` or `.` are ignored.

## Add a category yourself
Two ways - use whichever you like:

1. **List it in `config.js`** (best). Open `config.js` on GitHub, click the pencil icon, and add a line inside `categories: [ ... ]`:
   ```
   "Theology",
   { name: "Islamic Dilemma", description: "Short text shown under the title." },
   ```
   The category appears in the menu straight away, in the order you list it. Put its articles in `articles/theology/`, `articles/islamic-dilemma/` (name in lowercase, spaces become dashes).
2. **Just create the folder**: add an article at `articles/prayer/my-first.md` and a "Prayer" category appears automatically.

## Email icons
Clicking an email icon opens a small menu: **Open in Gmail** (web), **Open email app** (the phone or computer mail app) and **Copy email address**, so it works on every device.

## 3. Edit settings
Open `config.js` to change your email, WhatsApp number, author name and your list of categories.
Daily verses live in `assets/verses.js`.

## Notes
- If you use your own domain name (not github.io), fill in `owner` and `repo` in `config.js`.
- The site reads your article list from GitHub. If GitHub is busy (it allows about 60 requests per hour per visitor), a visitor may need to refresh later.
- Add `?nocache` to the web address to see a brand-new article immediately.


## Article listing and refresh behavior

- The article library and category pages show the first five articles initially. **More articles** reveals the next five at a time; **Collapse** hides the revealed batches while keeping the first five visible.
- The home page shows three latest articles, and article pages show up to three keyword-relevant related articles.
- Article data is rechecked after a short 15-second browser cache window. Fetch requests use cache-busting URLs to reduce stale browser/CDN responses. GitHub Pages and GitHub's own publication/CDN propagation can still introduce a short delay after a commit.
